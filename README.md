# 🌦 Weather Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **type of weather** (e.g., Sun, Rain, Drizzle, Snow) using a trained Machine Learning model.  
The dataset includes features such as precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and wind speed.  
A **Streamlit web application** is used for interactive, user-friendly predictions.

## 📌 Project Objective

The main goal is to develop a machine learning model that can classify different weather conditions based on input attributes, and deploy it using **Streamlit** for real-time prediction.
